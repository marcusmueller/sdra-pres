This doesn't apply to the Ettus logo, the GNU Radio logo, the CGRAN logo, the design of any of the software depicted in screenshots. These are used on a fair usage basis. Before using the Ettus logo, make sure you only use it to refer to Ettus Research or its products. Generally, the same applies for the other logos, too. So if in doubt, just write a quick mail to project/trademark owners.
